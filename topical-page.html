  5. Topical page: Technology and society — may be visually different 
</p>
<p>
  • Copy a short text (anywhere from 300 to 1000 words) from DATA1100 "DATA1100 
  Technology and Society for Programmers" or other subjects. (Or write a new, short text.) 
  </p>
  <p>
  • Add images (if there are none). Remember that in Norwegian copyright law, the name of 
  the photographer must always be included. (May be organisation, e.g.,"Scanpix"). 
  </p>
  <p>
  • Add headings (if there are none). 
  </p>
  <p>
  • Add links (if there are none). This text should have multiple links to external sites with 
  relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the information you link to is, 
  but we expect several links, and we expect it to be easy to understand before clicking what 
  information you lead us to.

  <p>
  • If you wish to show off some skills, but found that difficult with the other pages, you can 
  make this page different from the others, with a distinct visual of functional identity.
